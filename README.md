# hello-world
This is my first repo on GitHub. Whoot! 
My name is Lou, I'm LouD in Slack and am an ambivert in real life. 
My GitHub profile name comes from my college days when my nickname was Tigger. 
Folks could find my short self on campus by waiting for me to bounce with enthusiasm about my latest project/plan/club/radio show/knitted project.
